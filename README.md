Dear User, \
Welcome to the application **"Time Portal"** !

You can find it here:
- link: https://time-portal.netlify.app/
- code: https://github.com/AAPrikhodko/tt

Some notes:

1. To log in the application please input your userName.
2. The application has several pages
    - **Home page:** Here you can find some common information about the time
    - **Articles:** You will find here some stories about the time. That is just some mock data, not real ones.
    - **Tracker:** Shows you the time you spent on each page. You can navigate between the pages and the system will keep track how much time you spent on each of them.
      If you close the app, the time stops being tracked. There is a logout button, that also stops tracking the user's time and takes you back to the login page.
      If a user logs in at a later time, with the same login info (username), his time tracking will continue from last time.
      If another user logs in, his time will be tracked separately.
      The time is updated live, while you are on the time tracking page.
    - **About:** tells you some point of this application
3. The application has a responsive layout. It supports screen resolutions up to 375px (iPhone SE)
4. About stack technology. This app was created based on:
    - React library
    - Type Script
    - Ant Design library
    - SCSS preprocessor

Thank you for using "Time Portal" app!
